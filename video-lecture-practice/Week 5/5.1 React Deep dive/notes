React is just a easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS
It's a new syntax, the under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS

just how ChaGPT is an easier way to write code, React is a easier way to write HTML/CSS

Why react
People realised it's harder to do DOM manipulation the conventinal.

Some react jargon
To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things
Creators of frontend realised that all
websites can effectively be divided into two parts

State - An object that represents the current state of the app
It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change)
For example, the value of the counter

How a DOM element should render, given a state
It is a re-usable, dynaic, HTML snippet that changes given the state

State/Components/Re-rendering

You usually have to define all your components once
And then all you have to do is update the state
of your app, React takes care of re-rendering your app
